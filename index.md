# Thanks for visiting~

There are two things on this site, a stable release and an unstable release. So here's a brief explanation about those two:
- Stable release: I'm trying to make an explanation of a project easier to understand.
- Unstable release: I'm not even trying to explain anything, just a pure barebone trial and error.

Let's get started!

### Stable Release
- [Pavement Distress Detector using Single Shot Detector]

### Unstable Release
- [bruhtus' scrawl](https://bruhtus.github.io/scrawl)

## That's all, here it comes the BRUH MOMENTUM!
